work like a dog
world weary
worst nightmare
worth its weight in gold
write down
writing on the wall
wrong side of the bed
yanking your chain
yappy as a dog
years young
you are requested
you are what you eat
you can run but you can't hide
you only live once
you're going to
you're going to have to
you're going to need to
you're the boss
young and foolish
young and vibrant
your attention is drawn
zero-sum game
